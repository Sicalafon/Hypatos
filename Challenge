Hypatos Tester/Test Automation Engineer
Congratulations you made it through the initial interview. Now it’s time to show
your testing and coding skills. The following task should be self-explanatory,
but if you have any questions let us know and contact Wojciech Barczyński
(wb@hypatos.ai).
Working with an API application
Test a hello-world app (https://github.com/wojciech12/hello_printer_app):
1. Check the outputs: curl 127.0.0.1:5000/outputs

/App checked with linux command curl 127.0.0.1:5000/outputs after running main.py module with python

Responses:
plain, plain_uppercase, plain_lowercase, json


2. Check how the API works, e.g.:
curl '127.0.0.1:5000?output=plain'

It converts passed string into plain text within variable in views module

3. Verify the outpus and write API tests test/test_views.py and logic in
test/test_formater.py.

Please refer to test/test_formater.py and test_views.py

4. If there are any bugs fix them.

There was a couple of bugs. For example in plain text function user could pass string variable and numeric data type variable
which raises an error after concatination. For more please refer to the module

5. What other errors do you see there?

The json function was volnerable for passing special characters which breaks the valid structure of json such as " , {, }

6. Please include also a description of two test scenarios that shows a bug.
7. There is a simple ui, curl 127.0.0.1:5000/ui, test it as well.
Please refer to test_views.py.
